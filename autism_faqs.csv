Question,Answer
What’s Autism?,Autism and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are both general terms for a group of complex disorders of brain development.
Is Autism a mental illness?,"No autism is not a mental illness rather it is a mental condition present from early childhood, characterized by difficulty in communicating and forming relationships with other people and in using language and abstract concepts."
Is Asperger related to Autism?,"With the publication of the DSM-V Diagnostic Manual in May of 2013 previous subtypes of Autism such as PDD-NOS, Autistic Disorder and Asperger’s, were merged into one umbrella diagnosis referred to as ASD."
How common is Autism?,"Based on recent studies by Canadian researchers, the prevalence rate of ASD is 1 in 68. Autism is four times more frequent in boys than in girls."
Can children or youth with Autism are able to learn?,"The people with autism learn, and the rate at which they learn, can be totally different from others without autism. Therefore, those with autism sometimes need to learn things that we do not consider the part of learning."
What are the major causes of Autism?,"Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition. While the exact causes of autism are not fully understood, research suggests that a combination of genetic, environmental, and neurological factors contribute to its development. Here are some of the major causes and risk factors associated with autism:
1. Genetic Factors
Heredity: Autism tends to run in families, indicating a genetic predisposition. Certain genetic mutations or variations may increase the risk of ASD.
Gene Mutations: Spontaneous (de novo) mutations in certain genes during embryonic development can influence brain structure and function, contributing to ASD.
Syndromic Disorders: Genetic conditions like Fragile X Syndrome, Rett Syndrome, and Tuberous Sclerosis are associated with a higher likelihood of autism.
2. Environmental Factors
Prenatal Environment: Exposure to certain substances or conditions during pregnancy, such as infections, medications (like valproic acid or thalidomide), or high levels of stress, may increase the risk of autism.
Advanced Parental Age: Older parental age (both mother and father) at the time of conception is associated with a higher risk of autism in children.
Complications During Birth: Preterm birth, low birth weight, or oxygen deprivation during birth may contribute to developmental challenges, including autism.
Toxins and Pollution: Exposure to environmental toxins, heavy metals, or air pollution during critical periods of development may play a role.
3. Neurological Factors
Brain Development Abnormalities: Differences in brain growth and connectivity, particularly in areas related to communication and social interaction, are commonly observed in individuals with autism.
Neuroinflammation: Inflammation in the brain during early development might contribute to autism.
Neurotransmitter Imbalances: Dysregulation of neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine may affect brain function and behavior.
4. Interaction Between Genetics and Environment
Autism likely results from the interplay between genetic predispositions and environmental triggers. For example, a child with a genetic susceptibility to autism might develop ASD after exposure to certain environmental stressors.
5. Other Factors
Maternal Health Conditions: Conditions like diabetes, obesity, or autoimmune diseases during pregnancy may increase the risk.
Epigenetics: Changes in gene expression influenced by environmental factors may affect brain development and increase autism risk."
What are the major symptoms of Autism?,The children and youth with Autism normally: – hesitate to make eye contact – either unable to speak at all or speak just few words – are not social etc.
Who are the professionals working with children and youth with autism?,"A team of professionals such as speech pathologists, occupational therapist, psychologists, ABA therapist and other educators work with your autistic child."
"If I suspect that my child has autism, who should I contact for referral?","You can contact following health professional for referrals such as: family doctor, pediatrician, psychiatrist, psychologist, Speech-Language Pathologist (SLP), Occupational Therapist, Registered Nurse and a Social Worker; just to name a few, They can refer you case to Regional ABA Lead Agency"
What causes autism?,"There is no known cause of autism, but it is a form of neurodivergence that tends to run in families. Autism is a way of being a human, and being autistic is not a disease, disorder, or illness. Subsequently, there is no cure for autism. Rather, autistic people are able to thrive when they are accepted as their full selves and their needs are met."
Is autism genetic?,"Genes most likely play a role in people being autistic. This is supported by research that children with an autistic sibling are more likely to be diagnosed as autistic. That said, genetic factors are not the whole picture."
Do vaccines cause autism?,Vaccines do not cause autism. This is a fact that has been reaffirmed through numerous scientific studies and is robustly supported by the medical community.
What is autism spectrum disorder?,"In 2013, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Version 5 (DSM-5) created just one diagnostic category for autistic people—called autism spectrum disorder. Therefore, every autistic person, regardless of their specific traits, is now described as having autism spectrum disorder."
How is autism diagnosed?,"If a child is thought to be autistic, they will be seen by a team of professionals, including a child psychologist or psychiatrist, developmental-behavioral pediatrician, and child neurologist. The evaluation will include a medical history, physical exam, and testing of the child's social, language, and cognitive skills. Adults seeking a diagnosis will usually see a psychologist or psychiatrist."
What is high-functioning autism?,"High-functioning autism is not an official medical diagnosis and has many different definitions within the autistic community. The problem with labeling an autistic person as high functioning, and thus closer to neurotypical or ""normal"" on the spectrum of functioning, is that the term may be misleading and undermine their need for support."
What is autism?,"Autism is a neurodevelopmental condition which is usually diagnosed in the first 3 years of life. Generally parents become concerned when their child has delays in speech development, limited social relatedness, and restricted interests and activities. The child may avoid direct eye contact and exhibit odd behaviors such as focusing on parts of objects (e.g. the spinning wheel of a toy car). There may be unusual motor movements such as hand flapping, self stimulation or walking on toes.
Although the cause of autism is unknown, it is generally believed that etiology may be due to multiple factors. Many genetic, environmental, metabolic and neurological conditions that affect the normal functioning of the brain are being researched. The diagnosis of autism requires disturbances in each of three domains: (1) social relatedness, (2) communication/play, and (3) restricted interests and activities.
1. Social relatedness includes marked impairment in non-verbal communication, peer relationships and social-emotional reciprocity.
2. Communication/play includes either a delay or total lack of spoken language and lack of developmentally-appropriate make-believe or social play.
3. Restricted interests and activities includes encompassing preoccupations, adherence to non-functional routines or rituals, stereotypies and motor mannerisms.
Treatment planning is complex since each child has different strengths and deficits. Evidence that earlier detection and provision of services improves long term prognosis makes early diagnosis particularly important to improve the child’s adaptive skills and future functioning. The diverse expression of these disorders both across and within individuals presents particular challenges for clinical diagnosis and treatment."
What are early signs of autism?,"Parents and relatives should be concerned about their infant or toddler if they notice any of the following developmental delays or behavioral problems and discuss concerns with their child’s pediatrician to obtain appropriate referrals for evaluation:
1. lack of or delay in development of spoken language .
2. repetitive use of language and/or motor mannerisms (e.g., hand-flapping, twirling objects).
3. little or no eye contact.
4. lack of interest in peer relationships.
5. lack of spontaneous or make-believe play.
6. persistent fixation on parts of objects."
What are some symptoms of autism that parents and caregivers can look for ?,"Children diagnosed with autism tend to process and respond to information in the environment in unique ways. In some cases, parents are frightened because they exhibit aggressive and/or self-injurious behaviors which are difficult to manage.
1. Insistence on sameness in routines (O)
2. Difficulty in expressing needs verbally, using gestures or pointing instead of words (C)
3. Repeating words or phrases in place of normal, responsive language (C)
4. Laughing (and/or crying) for no apparent reason; showing distress for reasons not apparent to others (S)
5. Prefers to be alone; aloof manner evident to strangers and family members (S)
6. Tantrums and low frustration tolerance (S)
7. Difficulty in initiating social contact with others (S)
8. Uncomfortable with physical contact even when given with affection such as a hug (S)
9. Little or no eye contact even when spoken to directly (S)
10. Unresponsive to normal teaching methods (S)
11. Plays with toys as objects (example bangs a toy car as a block rather than as a moving vehicle) (S)
12. Focus on spinning objects such as a fan or the propeller of a toy helicopter (O)
13. Obsessive attachment to particular objects (O)
14. Apparent over-sensitivity or under-sensitivity to pain (S)
15. No real fears of danger despite obvious risks of harm. (S)
16. Noticeable physical over-activity or extreme under-activity (S)
17. Impaired fine motor and gross motor skills (S)
18. Non-responsive to verbal instructions; often appears as if child is deaf although hearing tests in normal range (C)
Legend: Communication (C), Obsessive-Compulsive Behavior (O), Social (S)"
What is the difference between autism and Asperger's disorder?,"Unlike children with autism, individuals with Asperger’s disorder do not present with delays in language acquisition or with marked unusual behaviors and environmental responsiveness during the first years of life. Consequently parents often have no concerns about their child’s early development. A child with Asperger's may be diagnosed later than 3 years old because they are achieving their developmental milestones at a normal rate and are only referred for evaluation because parents observe that they are behaving differently from same aged peers. They may appear socially awkward, lack awareness of conventional social rules, or show limited empathy to others. Social interaction is affected because of diminished eye contact, disengagement in conversations, and inability to pick up social cues or understand the meaning of gestures
Speech patterns may be unusual and lack inflection or may be formal, but excessively loud or high pitched. Children with Asperger's may not understand the subtleties of language, such as irony and humor. Frequently, they may not recognize the give-and-take nature of a conversation and this translates into difficulty initiating and/or maintaining conversations. Their communication is sometimes described as “one way” so they appear to be “talking at” others instead of to them.
For example, a child diagnosed with Asperger’s disorder had social problems due to his restricted and circumscribed interests. In his conversations with peers, he delivered monologues on his favorite subject of planets in a slow methodical way. He was so involved in talking about the planets that he did not notice the frustration of his peers. Attempts to interject comments to initiate conversation were missed and the child continued to “lecture”. Consequently the other children eventually walked away feeling unfulfilled by the lack of connection and bored by the persistence of the same topic.
Another distinction between Asperger's syndrome and autism concerns cognitive ability. While some individuals with autism experience intellectual disability, by definition a person with Asperger's cannot possess a ""clinically significant"" cognitive delay, and most possess average intelligence. The outcome in Asperger’s disorder generally appears to be better than that for autism, although this may, in part, relate to better cognitive and/or verbal abilities."
Are there treatments available for autism?,"There are no specific treatments to “cure” autism. Each child with an autism spectrum disorder has a unique constellation of developmental delays, speech deficits, social and cognitive impairments. Therefore, comprehensive treatment plans need to be developed to target each child's unique profile of strengths and functional impairments."
Are there medication treatments for autism?,"There are no medication treatments that treat the core symptoms of autism. However, often children with autism exhibit disturbing repetitive, stereotypical or self injurious behaviors that can be distressing to both the child and the parent. In cases when a child may be hitting himself repetitively, has mood instability or is aggressive to other children or family members, medication intervention may be warranted. The FDA has approved use of the medication risperidone to target aberrant behaviors of autism such as severe mood instability and aggression. There are other medications that are currently being studied to help reduce problem behaviors in autism but there are no other FDA approved treatments. Pharmacological interventions may increase the ability of persons with ASD to profit from educational and other interventions, and to remain in less restrictive environments through the management of severe and challenging accompanying behaviors. Frequent targets for medication include features such as aggression, self-injurious behavior, hyperactivity, inattention, anxiety, compulsive-like behaviors, other repetitive or stereotypic behaviors, and sleep disturbances. Sometimes SSRIs are used to address symptoms of mood or anxiety in children and adolescents with autism."
Why do children with autism have difficulty learning in a regular classroom setting?,"There are many reasons that a child diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders is not able to learn in a regular classroom setting. These include but are not limited to the following reasons:
1. coexisting learning disabilities.
2. coexisting intellectual disability.
3. speech and communication delays.
4. aggression to self or others.
5. affective Instability.
6. require individual supervision to participate in the classroom.
7. social reciprocity problems.
Therefore special efforts need to be made by parents and caregivers to explore options so that the child’s abilities are maximized. Availability of resources differs by community so it is important to contact a child and adolescent psychiatrist or pediatrician to discuss the options available in your community."

The diagnosis of pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified (PDD, NOS) is a diagnosis characterized by severe and persistent impairment in responding appropriately in social interaction that is associated with either 1) impairment in verbal or nonverbal communication skills, OR 2) stereotyped behavior, restricted interests and activities. This diagnosis is made when the symptoms or characteristics do not meet full criteria for a specific pervasive developmental disorder, schizotypal personality disorder, avoidant personality disorder or other psychiatric disorder.
Although, DSM-IV-TR does not offer specific diagnostic criteria for PDDNOS, there are at least five subgroups of individuals within PDDNOS:
1. atypical autism: young children who have not yet developed full –blown autistic disorder; individuals who “almost but not quite” meet the full criteria for autistic disorder (i.e., broader autism phenotype or lesser variant autism; patients who have a late onset (i.e., after age 3 years) of autistic disorder.
2. residual autism: individuals who had a history of having autistic disorder but presently do not meet the criteria for autistic disorder (i.e., still having some autistic features subsequent to effective interventions and/or natural development)
3. atypical Asperger's disorder: young children who have not yet developed full-blown Asperger's disorder and individuals who ‘almost but not quite” meet the full criteria for Asperger's disorder.
4. Mixed features of atypical autism and atypical Asperger's disorder
5. Comorbid autism: children with a medical or neurological disorder (e.g., tuberous sclerosis) associated with some ""autistic features""

What are Autism Signs and Symptoms in Social Communication?,"Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may have challenges in social communication. You might notice some of the following signs:
• Limited response:Your child may not respond when you call their name or may not seem to hear you at times.
• Preference for solitude:They might resist being cuddled and prefer to play alone, withdrawing into their own space.
• Eye contact issues:Poor eye contact and a lack of facial expressions are common.
• Speech difficulties:Some children might not speak at all or show delays in speech development. In some cases, they may lose previously learned words or sentences.
• Conversation challenges:They might struggle to start or maintain a conversation. When they do speak, it may only be for requests or to name objects.
• Unique speech patterns:Their voice might sound unusual, such as using a singsong tone or robotic speech.
• Echolalia:They may repeat words or phrases without understanding their meaning.
• Understanding problems:Some may not grasp simple questions or directions.
• Emotion expression:There may be a lack of expression regarding emotions or an unawareness of others’ feelings.
• Sharing interests:Your child might not point to or bring objects to share with others.
• Social interaction issues:They may approach social situations in inappropriate ways, such as being passive, aggressive, or disruptive.
• Difficulty with nonverbal cues:Recognizing facial expressions, body language, or tone of voice can be a struggle."
What are Autism Signs and Symptoms in Patterns of Behaviour?,"Repetitive behaviors and specific interests are often seen in children and adults with autism spectrum disorder. These are one of the defining autism signs and symptoms. You may notice some of these behaviors:
• Repetitive movements:Common actions include rocking, spinning, or flapping hands.
• Self-harm activities:Some might engage in self-harm, like biting or banging their heads.
• Ritualistic behavior:They often create routines and may become upset if there are small changes.
• Coordination issues:This can involve clumsiness or odd movements, like walking on tiptoes or having stiff body language.
• Fascination with details:Your child may focus intensely on small details of objects, such as the wheels on a toy, without understanding how these objects function.
• Sensitivity to stimuli:Some children are extra sensitive to lights, sounds, or touch, yet may not react to pain or temperature changes.
• Play limitations:They might not participate in pretend play or mimic others in social settings.
• Intense interests:A fixation on a certain object or activity can be marked by unusual intensity or focus.
• Food preferences:It’s possible for your child to have strict eating habits, refusing certain textures or only eating a few specific foods.
As children with autism grow older, some may become more engaged with others and display fewer behavior issues. Those with less severe challenges may ultimately lead typical lives. In contrast, some may continue to face difficulties in language and social skills, especially during their teenage years, which can lead to increased emotional and behavioral challenges.
Autism Spectrum Disorder Signs and Symptoms"
Autism Signs and Symptoms when to see a doctor?,"Children develop at different rates, and many do not meet the timelines suggested in parenting books. That said, those with autism spectrum disorder often show signs of delayed development before they turn 2 years old. If you have concerns about your child’s development or suspect they may have ASD, it is important to consult with your physician. Symptoms of autism can also share similarities with other developmental disorders."
What are the Autism Signs and Symptoms?,"Early indicators of autism spectrum disorder typically involve noticeable delays in speech and social skills. Your doctor may conduct developmental tests if your child displays some of the following signs:
• Response to emotions:Your child should respond with a smile or happy expression by 6 months.
• Mimicking:By 9 months, they should mimic sounds or facial expressions.
• Babbling:Cooing or babbling should be present by 12 months.
• Gestures:Pointing or waving should occur by 14 months.
• First words:Saying single words should happen by 16 months.
• Pretend play:By 18 months, your child should engage in make-believe play.
• Two-word phrases:Speaking in two-word phrases should start by 24 months.
• Loss of skills:Losing language or social skills at any age should prompt a consultation.
Recognizing these signs and seeking help early can make a significant difference in your child’s development and quality of life."
What are Autism Vaccines and Autism Spectrum Disorder?,"You may have heard discussions linking childhood vaccines to autism spectrum disorder. This topic has generated a lot of debate. However, research does not support any connection between vaccines and autism.
Many studies conducted over the years have found no reliable evidence that links vaccines to the development of autism spectrum disorder. The original research that raised these concerns has been retracted. This was due to significant flaws in its design and methods.
It’s important to recognize that not vaccinating your child can have serious consequences. Children who do not receive their vaccinations are at higher risk of contracting and spreading dangerous diseases. Conditions like whooping cough, measles, and mumps can pose serious health threats. Vaccinations play a key role in protecting your child and others in the community.
In sum, while the causes of autism spectrum disorder are still being studied, you can trust that vaccines are safe and do not cause the disorder. Keeping your child up to date with vaccinations is essential for their health and the safety of those around them."
What are Autism Factors That Increase Risk?,"Several factors may contribute to a higher likelihood of your child being diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Understanding these can help you be more aware of potential risks.
• Child’s Gender: Boys are approximately four times more likely to be diagnosed with ASD compared to girls.
• Family History: If you have one child with autism, there is an increased chance of having another child with the same condition. Additionally, some parents or family members may show mild social or communication difficulties similar to those seen in ASD.
• Coexisting Conditions: Certain medical disorders can elevate the risk of ASD. Conditions include:Fragile X Syndrome: An inherited condition leading to intellectual difficulties.Tuberous Sclerosis: This causes benign tumors to form in the brain.Rett Syndrome: Almost always affecting girls, this genetic disorder results in slowed head growth, intellectual challenges, and loss of purposeful hand movements.
• Fragile X Syndrome: An inherited condition leading to intellectual difficulties.
• Tuberous Sclerosis: This causes benign tumors to form in the brain.
• Rett Syndrome: Almost always affecting girls, this genetic disorder results in slowed head growth, intellectual challenges, and loss of purposeful hand movements.
• Preterm Birth: Infants born before 26 weeks of gestation may face a higher risk of developing autism or autism-like symptoms.
• Advanced Parental Age: There may be a possible link between older parents and the likelihood of having a child with ASD. More studies are needed to fully understand this relationship.
Being aware of these risk factors can help you seek timely support and resources for your child."
What are Autism Challenges?,"Issues with communication and behavior can result in:
• Difficulties in school and learning
• Job-related struggles
• Challenges in living independently
• Increased social isolation
• Family stress
• Risk of bullying or victimization"
What is Autism?,"Autism is the name of a type of Human Neurology, which includes the Brain and the Nervous System.Neurology is the process of the human body taking in sensory information, moving it around the body, processing it and then reacting to it.Autistic people actively process more sensory information than non-Autistic people and that can create big differences in processing speeds, communication styles and how we interpret and interact with the world. There is no negativity or positivity in this, just difference.Most descriptions of Autism won't tell you this, they're too busy telling you their perception of the negative impacts of Autistic Neurology."
What is Asperger's Syndrome?,"Asperger’s Syndrome is a Diagnosis with a really complicated and confusing back story and a lot of myth and misunderstanding wrapped up with it.  There is also a lot of controversy attached to it for many reasons. It was the diagnosis I received aged 23, although I now choose not to associate with it. I'm Autistic.

Asperger's Syndrome is NOT a subtype of Autism, it IS Autism.  There are historical political and clinical reasons for there being two diagnostic labels.  The article linked below, as briefly as possible, gives full context to this label, which by 2022 will no longer exist as a new diagnosis.Please read it in full and try not to get caught up on the smaller, more controversial aspects."
What are Learning Disabilities?,"Learning Disability, or LD (known as Intellectual Disability in some cases) is an umbrella term for a number of disabilities which impact on someone's ability to learn and interact with the world very much based on their IQ and the world's perception of what is the 'right way' to learn and exist.Identifiable Learning Disabilities are co-occurring conditions given to between 15-40% of Autistic people (dependant on the research).  Those Autistic people are usually the ones slapped with a problematic 'Low Functioning Autism' label, or worse 'Severe' Autism. (See my FAQ on Functioning Labels)"
What is Neurodiversity?,"The Neurodiversity paradigm is simply a way of understanding that there are many different people in the world with minds that work a little differently to help make them individuals.Sub-groups of humanity exist whose Neurological function from conception is markedly different from the rest of Humanity, these are called Neurodivergencies (singular: Neurodivergent) and include people who are Autistic, ADHD, BiPolar, Tourette's and so on.It is also possible to have acquired Neurodivergence.  So for example someone who may have been brain damaged in some way, or developed a Disease like Dementia."
What are co-occurring conditions?,"Co-occurring conditions are simply any stand-alone conditions that you have.  When you are Autistic it is likely that you have any of a large number of co-occurring conditions which occur regularly amongst Autistic people.  Although 'officially' research states that most Autistic people have one co-occurring condition, anecdotally it's a greater number.Through my work I have identified over 60 different co-occurring conditions, some present from birth and some acquired, these range from the obvious like ADHD, Dyslexia and Dyspraxia, to lesser well known ones such as Hyperlexia, Alexithymia and C-PTSD"
What is Autistic Masking?,"Masking is a psychological safety mechanism made up of layers of physical and social complex actions which an Autistic person uses consciously and unconsciously to ‘fit in’ and self-protect in an endless variety of differing situations and environments. 

This happens by applying, in fluctuating degrees, often uncontextualised and sometimes rehearsed, learnt behaviours to appropriate situations; whilst simultaneously suppressing both natural behaviours and self-identity. 

All this happens partly consciously with, over time, the person dissociating from the act; and partly subconsciously: pre-emptive, reactive and unplanned; And all at great mental and physical cost.

It's common amongst Autistic children and Adults and often is cited as one of the reasons that Autistic children are unidentified and not properly supported within schools.  The phrase ""They're fine in school."" is often used by teachers in reference to pupils who Mask.

Autistic Masking is now being recognised as a factor in the high suicide rate amongst Autistic people and is an identifiable factor in Autistic Burnout."
What is Autistic Burnout?,"One of the knock on effects of being Autistic in a world not designed for Autistic people, is how exhausting it is.  Constantly combatting sensory overload, communicating in ways not conducive for you, Autistic Masking, all takes up huge amounts of energy.  That adds up over time and leads to what is known as Autistic Burnout.  It's similar in physical expression to Clinical Depression and is starting to be identified with Autistic 'regression'."
Why are senses so important for Autistic people?,"Sensory information in integral to all humans ability to live.  Without sensory any sensory information we would die. All that sensory information is taken into the human body through the senses via the central Nervous system.  Although there are many sub senses there are 8 main ones which include: sight (Visual), taste (Gustatory), touch (Tactile), smell (Olfactory), hearing (Aural), balance (vestibular), internal messages (interoception) and body awareness (proprioception). The Nervous system is intrinsically part of the neurological system, so differences in sensory interpretation are very much at the heart of what makes Autistic people different from non-Autistic people. Autistic people take in more sensory information and often at different rates to non-Autistic people.Humans help themselves to regulate this information through self-stimulatory behaviour, these are repetitive movements or repetitive (verbal or mental) vocalisations.  Autistic people call this Stimming and because we take in and process so much more information, our Stimming can be more noticeable and take the form of things like handflapping, jigging, making noises, singing and dancing and much more"
What are Meltdowns and Shutdowns?,"Meltdowns and Shutdowns are overwhelm and trauma responses to a combination of too much sensory information and dysregulated emotions (including frustration, anger, sadness, happiness and excitement)A meltdown is an externalised physical response, a Shutdown is an internalised physical response.Neither of these things is a tantrum or 'challenging' behaviour, as neither is a choice. Nor do either have an intended outcome. Though tantrums can lead to Meltdowns."
Education issues,"Many parents struggle with their Autistic children's education and the Education system generally. There many reasons for this, ranging from poor quality Autism education and the way the education is set up."
What is the best way to support myself as an Autistic Adult?,"Finding other Autistic people is imperative to finding yourself.  There are supportive Autistic communities Social Media from whom you can learn about Autism from an inside perspective. Often you'll find that the Autistic understanding of Autism is VASTLY different to the Professional understanding. There are many reasons for this which are described in the articles linked below.Also if you visit my Partners page, there are links to organisations and services which can support Autistic people around employment and family support.Please be aware that understanding of Autism outside of the Autistic community is limited and that good services are few and far between."
Diagnosis - Adult or child,"There are many and various barriers to diagnosis fro both adults and children, but if you are willing to seek one, the first place to start is your General Practitioner.  I would always advise gathering as much evidence as possible around the diagnostic criteria.

For children the process generally involves a multi team assessment involving a Practitioner, Speech and Language Therapist (Pathologist), a Psychologist and partaking of ADOS (an assessment tool).For adults it usually involves just a Psychologist and ADOS.For both it's important to evidence not only the now, but historically, as the criteria and process rely on showing that 'defecits' (as they are described) have existed from birth and aren't the result of specific trauma.The diagnostic criteria is very pathological and views Autistic people through a behavioural lens whereby it actively seeks anxiety behaviours.  It can be difficult viewing yourself like this and this is one of its greatest flaws."
What is the issue with Jigsaw pieces?,"The Jigsaw piece has a controversial and difficult history when it comes to Autistic people.It was first used in connection with Autism in te 1960's by the UK's National Autistic Society, a parent organisation, to represent what was missing from their children.  The multi-coloured jigsaw pieces (and ribbon) were then adopted by other Autism organisations.  The colours are very bright and represent children.Autism Speaks, a huge controversial American charity who were formed to prove that vaccines cause Autism and have continued with cure, used a blue jigsaw piece for their logo and now that colour has also become synonimous with Autism.For many Autistic people the jigsaw piece is a symbol of EVERYTHING that is wrong with the Autism narrative and why such inequality exists"
What are Functioning labels and why is language important?,"The language used around Autism and Autistic people is really important.Things like functioning labels which can create expectations and assumptions around competence and set people up to fail and of course the argument around whether it is best to say Autistic or a person 'has' Autism.The Autistic community advocates generally for the removal of Functioning Labels and for the use of Identity First Language. (EG. I'm Kieran, I'm Autistic)"
How do I know if someone is Autistic?,"Autism, like many other neurodivergent conditions, is an invisible disability which exists on a spectrum. As a result, Autistic traits are not universal and are often specific to the person. Autistic adults can go without a diagnosis for years, often well into middle age. This is especially true of women on the spectrum who are prone to masking their traits  that is to say, disguising them from their peers."
Can an Autistic person live independently?,"With the right supports, Autistic people can live as independently as anyone else. It is important to stress that given Autisms nature as a spectrum, support needs are often fluid. One Autistic adult may live independently but need certain supports for work.This may be the opposite for another."
Can an Autistic person work?,"With the right support, Autistic people can enter the working world. Much like their neurotypical peers this depends on vocation, education, and levels of training. Some will work for a few hours on a defined task whereas others may pursue full-time work. ForAutism-specific supports there are organisations such as Specialisterne, AHEAD and Not So Different. These groups assist Autistic people in developing the skills to enter the workplace. Additionally, workplaces have a legal obligation to provide Reasonable Accommodations - these ensure employees with additional needs are supported in their place of work."
Is Autism an intellectual disability?,No. An intellectual disability is broadly defined as impacting on ones adaptability and reasoning skills. An Autistic person may however be separately diagnosed with an intellectual disability alongside an Autism diagnosis.
What is the difference between 'Autism' and 'Autistic?',"Autism is a noun, a name for the Autism spectrum and its associated conditions.Autistic is usually an adjective used to describe behaviours and challenges linked to Autism. It is also used as a noun by several people on the spectrum as a means of referring to themselves.AsIAm has a policy of using identity-first language when referring to individuals on the spectrum as Autistic rather than as person-first (i.e. person with Autism). Many Autistic people see their condition as a positive part of their personal identities and not as a disability. Some may find person-first language clinical and patronising. Its important to acknowledge this and good practice to ask a person how they would like to be referred to."
Which professionals work with Autistic people?,"Autistic people, depending on their support needs, may need to work with several professionals throughout their lives. This may be for diagnostic reasons, building self-development skills, or gaining self-management skills.These professionals includeCounsellors, Paediatricians, Educational Psychologists, OccupationalTherapists, and Speech and Language Therapists."
Why are more boys diagnosed with Autism than girls?,"Boys are four times more likely to be diagnosed as Autistic than girls. However, it is not thought that boysare more likely to be Autistic. There are a few possible reasons for this mismatch.It is likely that Autism is not being recognised in girls as often by communities, families, teachers and doctors because they are not considering it as an option for females. It is also likely that the current diagnosis process might be missing key signs in Autistic females. One of the possible explanations for the gender imbalance in Autism is that females are thought to be better at masking their neurotypical behaviours than males are. Masking describes the process whereby individuals learn and mimic what is thought to be typical social behaviour. However, it is important to note that often girls are not aware that this is something they are doing - it is unconscious. Another possible explanation for the gender bias in diagnosis is that sometimes Autistic girls might develop strong interests that are considered more typical for their gender, such as in glitter or horse riding. Additionally, girls might stim in a way that is considered to be typical girly behaviour such as twirling their hair. It is hugely important that more attention is given to decreasing the gender bias inAutism diagnoses as the lack of understanding can have a negative impact on these females' lives. What can happen for girls whose diagnosis goes unnoticed is that masking can become too much for them. Usually, during a girls teenage years the increase in hormones and general stress of the adolescent stages of development can intensify things. A build-up of many years of masking can lead the individual to a crisis or a breaking point. Sometimes a girl will attend therapy for anxiety, and they can often be misdiagnosed with personality disorders, but ultimately continue to feel like nothing is adding up for them.Receiving an Autism diagnosis can cause a sense of relief for many girls who have spent their lives masking their individuality. An accurate Autism diagnosis can bring many positive changes to Autistic girls lives, including greater understanding of themselves, a positive self-identity and a sense of belonging with a group of people who understand them. Hopefully, as the stigma surrounding Autism reduces and our understanding improves, parents and the wider community will become better at recognising the signs in both their sons and their daughters, and seek a diagnosis at an earlier stage for their child."
Do vaccines cause Autism?,"No  its been widely disproven that vaccines cause Autism in young childrens brains. The Royal College ofPhysicians in Ireland has conducted an in-depth study on the possible risks of vaccination and found this to be a myth with no medical basis.Accredited international medical professionals have carried out similar reviews investigating whether there is a connection between Autism and vaccines and their results have repeatedly found no link.For more information, visit the HSE websites section on FAQs about vaccines."
How does an Autism Diagnosis affect social interaction?,"It is important to remember that Autistic people often approach non-verbal communication differently in comparison to neurotypical individuals. They may not use or interpret hand gestures the same way as a neurotypical person. Due to differences in eye contact, an Autistic person might look away from the person they are speaking to. This can be confusing for those who are not used to speaking with Autistic people. Secondly, Autistic people are likely to be comforted by routine and predictability. Conversations with new people may be intimidating, especially if they happen in an unfamiliar environment. For example, an Autistic person may be adept at interacting in a classroom or workplace but might not know how to approach someone at a party ora sports game.Thirdly, Autistic people are often direct and straightforward in how they communicate, avoiding generic conversation topics in favour of topics they find meaningful. This can result in giving an impression of bluntness or disinterest."
How can I support Autistic people in social interaction,"The way Autism is understood has changed a lot over the lastfew decades. Experts previously asserted that Autistic people had impairments in empathy or even had no interest in socialising. As a result, Autism supports were based on the idea that Autistic people lacked social skills and needed to learn the right way to interact. However, the commonly perceived notion thatAutistic people have no Theory of Mind, is now being challenged.Dr Damian Miltons Double Empathy problem notes that empathy is a two-way interaction. Non-Autistic people struggle to understand the emotions of Autistic people just as much as the other way around. The difficulty may lie in how people with different ways of experiencing the world interact. When supporting Autistic people to socialise, bear this two-way process in mind. On a practical level, the best way to help is to identify which elements of social interaction are the most challenging for the person in question. If their difficulty lies in non-verbal cues or gestures, it might be helpful to make certain things more explicit through visual guides or narratives. If they have difficulty initiating conversation, try to rehearse certain social scripts, with different scripts for different contexts. Autistic people should be encouraged to practise these interactions and reflect on how they went.This allows them to decide which strategies work best for them. Supporting an Autistic person in socialising should be about empowering them to express themselves and their needs authentically. It should not be teaching them to self-censor or feel there is something wrong with them for not wanting to talk about certain subjects. Try to look at social interaction through a salad bar approach. Do not hand someone a set of rules: present them with options and let them choose themselves. "
How can non-Autistic people communicate more clearly with their Autistic peers?,"Autistic people may require help in refining certain social skills, but the onus should not entirely be on them. Whether it is as a teacher, manager or even parent, neurotypical people should try to meet Autistic people halfway when socialising. If you find that an Autistic person is not responding to certain cues, try putting your language into words and making your thoughts and feelings more explicit. For example,these boxes are very heavy might be a clue to some people, but try saying could you help me carry these to make your intentions clearer.This goes the same for non-verbal cues: tapping a watch may be a recognised sign of time running out, but informing the person will always be clearer. Autistic people often avoid eye contact due to the sensory overload this produces. If they are looking away while speaking or listening, they are likely doing this to concentrate fully on the interaction. Do not attempt to force eye contact from them - this will probably be a source of distress. It is a common misconception that Autistic people do not want social interaction or friendship. In reality, the challenges of social interaction can be intimidating or a source of anxiety for Autistic people. In a friendship, both theAutistic person and the neurotypical person need to make an effort with communication. Neurotypical individuals should try to learn more about Autism, specifically about their Autistic peers. Try to learn what their interests are; this is always a sure way to get them talking. This does not mean you cannot express upset or offence in social interaction. It means changing the way youcommunicate this. Autistic people are just as capable as anyone else of being impolite or inconsiderate.If something an Autistic person does or says upsets you, consider why you are upset. Is this related to asocial convention you know they are not following? Was their behaviour a voluntary action or part of a stim? Weigh up each of these possibilities. If this is due to an involuntary action or stim, telling them to stop may make them feel self-conscious or anxious. If you are sure this isnt the case, express how you feel about what they are doing. However, you should question whether what they are doing is harmful to others, or just making you uncomfortable. It is possible what you consider unusual or impolite might be subjective. Remember that the rules of social interaction are norms, not laws. "
How can I help a neurotypical child understand Autism?,"Your non-Autistic child might not fully understand Autism. It is important to take time to explain to them the differences and preferences of the Autistic community and those of their sibling in particular, in an age-appropriate way. It is important for them to understand why your family might be different and may do things differently from others. This type of conversation can help them understand their Autistic sibling better and foster an environment of acceptance. There are many books available online that can help you to explain this to your child in an age-appropriate way, such as:  Autism in my family Sandra Tucker What Autism can belike Sue Adams Yknow that kid?Noeleen Smith The AwesomeAutistic Go-To Guide: A Practical Handbook for Autistic Teens and Tweens Yenn Purkis & Tanya Masterman."
What is Sensory Overload and why is it so common with Autism?,"The purpose of our sensory processing is to keep us calm but alert in relation to what is going on in our environment. If individuals are not able to filter through the sensory information in their environment it can be more difficult to remain calm or alert. This build-up of sensory information is referred to as sensory overload. This can feel different for different people. An individual experiencing sensory overload may become irritable, anxious, upset or even completely shut down in their attempt to regulate their sensory environment. While sensory overload is not exclusive to Autism, it is experienced more acutely by Autistic people.Our bodies have a number of automatic reactions that occur when faced with potentially threatening or dangerous situations. These reactions are called our fight or flight reaction and are built into our bodies to enable us to escape quickly should that be necessary. Part of this fight or flight reaction is that our senses become heightened or more sensitive.This begins with our eardrums changing shape to allow in lower-frequency sounds that we would usually filter out. Our eyes also become more alert and also scan the environment more frequently and rapidly. At a physiological level, our heart might begin to race, and our breathing might become quicker which pumps oxygen to our muscles so we are ready to run. Sometimes however, the threat is not a physical one, i.e. we are not actually in physical danger, rather we experience psychological stress such as receiving unexpected bad news, having an exam or test or a falling out with a friend. But the reaction in our body can be the same.Alongside the emotional upset, we will become more sensitive to sensation. For example, if we are feeling stressed and someone touches us we may jump because we have become more sensitive to sensory input. This in turn can make us more emotionally upset, so it can become a cycle of sensory sensitivity and stress. For Autistic individuals who tend to be naturally more sensitive to sensory input, minimising other stressors in the environment or routine is as important as sensory calming activities in preventing sensory overload."
Do All Therapists Take Autistic Clients?,"All therapists, once they have completed their essential training should have an understanding of Autism. It is important that therapists should broaden their services to accept a wider range of clients and should expand their level of service to meet the needs of Autistic people. Although professionals working in talk therapy should have the training and a basic understanding of Autism they might not feel they are fully capable of meeting your needs.It might be useful to check in advance with your therapist if they have experience of working with Autistic clients before or to check what their level of understanding is to ensure you can receive the best therapy fit for you."
How can a school change their teaching to better meet the needs of Autistic students?,"There are a number of elements of the school environment that might make the learning experience more challenging for Autistic students, for example the sensory environment, transferability of skills from subject to subject or lack of direct or clear instruction. Sometimes Autistic students might need a lot more reinforcement to cement the concepts they are learning to their memory. Teachers must adapt their teaching styles to make sure they meet the needs of every student in the classroom so that each child can access the curriculum. Most importantly, teachers need to be aware of the childs individual profile. Where do the students strengths lie? What parts of the curriculum do they find challenging?Ideally, Autism Friendly education is best when its applied on a school-wide level, as done through AsIAms Autism Friendly School programme which provides Autism guidance not only to teachers but on a school-wide level. However, if a teacher wishes to start with more gradual changes or wishes to prove the value of Autism friendly teaching, there are a number of options available.Sensory Challenges: If you are planning on conducting a science experiment in your class and you know that one of your students experiences sensory challenges when it comes to smells, perhaps you need to arrange for the experiment to be filmed for that student because they may not be able to sit in on the class. 	Perfectionism: Another way a teacher can vary their teaching to best meet the students needs is by altering the timings that they use in class. For some Autistic students, they might feel pressure to do every element of their work perfectly which might mean that the work ends up taking them much longer to complete than it would for other students in their class. For example, you might limit the amount of time a student should spend on their work, saying that they are to spend no more than 20 minutes on an activity and it does not matter if they do not complete the work in that time.Learning Styles: In terms of playing on a students strengths, teachers should use a variety of resources in their teaching. For example, students who are strong visual or aural learners might benefit from the use of video clips in the classroom. You could ask students to find an interesting YouTube video based on a topic they are learning in class. Teachers could provide students with different options for their homework such as a choice of 3 different questions or activities, each focusing on a different learning style.Group Work: Sometimes in school, you are required to work in groups which can be challenging for Autistic students. A way that teachers can make this process a little bit easier for their Autistic students is by giving them a very clear, specific role in the group, for example asking them to be the timekeeper.Note Taking: Some Autistic children might struggle with writing or typing notes or might not be able to keep up with the note-taking pace of the other students in the class. Perhaps you could suggest that the student take a photo of the notes on the board so that they can work on their notes in their own time. Alternatively, you might suggest that they focus on taking down key words or use visual forms of note-taking like an infographic or spider diagram instead."
What laws support Autistic people in the workplace?,"There are a number of Irish and EU laws which support both Autistic people and people with disabilities. These laws also combat discrimination against people with disabilities when they enter the workplace. Article 27 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD) provides that every disabled person has the right to work, and provides a wide range of rights which allow people with disabilities to participate in the workplace on an equal basis as their non-disabled peers. These rights include the right to be protected from discrimination, to receive equal working conditions, to have equal access to training and career development opportunities and to on-the-job supports, and to have access to reasonable accommodations at work. The 2000 Equal Treatment Framework Directive intends to combat both direct and indirect discrimination on the grounds of disability. It also directs measures to accommodate the needs of disabled people. This includes making adjustments to the workplace, provided that this does not pose a disproportionate burden to the employer. The Equal Status Acts 2000 includes people with disabilities under its nine grounds of discrimination. The Employment Equality Acts has more specific measures which outlaw discrimination in the workplace on disability grounds against employees. This includes application forms, interviews, aptitude tests, equal pay, access to employment and vocational training, promotion and disciplinary issues. Section 33 of The Employment Equality Act allows employers to take positive measures, like hiring quotas or additional workplace supports. These supports are aimed at attracting people with disabilities and addressing discrimination against people with disabilities at work more widely."
What organisations help Autistic people navigate the workplace and employment?,"EmployAbility services provide an employment support service for people who require support, whether they are experiencing illness, injury or are jobseekers with a disability. It is also a recruitment advice service for the business community. Your local EmployAbility service will give you employment help. It also gives employers access to a pool of potential employees, employment support for both employer and employer and guidance towards support grants.For more information, click here.National Learning NetworkA variety of access and training courses and support services are available to people needing specialist support in their search for work and within employment. Many of these courses are vocational and education programmes which can be accessed on a flexible basis. You can view a directory of the NLAs offered subjects here.The Transition Action Plan (TAP) is another NLN programme specifically for young Autistic people. It aims to ease the transition from school or childrens services to adulthood and a wide range of educational, rehabilitation and vocational opportunities are explored. TAP is only offered in Letterkenny, Co. Donegal, presently.SOLASSOLAS provides online learning services in Further Education and Training (FET) courses. The courses are free, and you may be paid a training allowance for the duration of your chosen pathway. SOLAS also offers accredited apprenticeships in different trades, work placements as well as in-work supports.Specialisterne IrelandSpecialisterne is a social innovator organisation aimed at upskilling and mentoring Autistic people within the Information Technology sector. The company recognises the special skills and unique advantages that Autistic individuals can bring to science and technology projects. It works with several major computer and software firms in offices across the world, offering assessments and job coaching for successful applicants to work within the business.Careers Service Northern IrelandIn the Careers Service Northern Ireland, Disablement Employment Advisers (DEAs) help adults with disabilities find suitable employment or training. They can also advise employers about adapting the workplace or supporting disabled people at work. The Service also offers careers advice."
Should I choose an Occupational Therapist who has experience working with Autistic people?,"As Occupational Therapy is not a medical model of therapy or treatment, an Occupational Therapist will not focus on an individuals diagnosis. Instead, the Occupational Therapist will focus on the individual and the occupations that they may struggle with. However, given many Autistic people view Autism as part of their identity rather than a condition to be studied, it is important that providers of Occupational Therapy have a thorough understanding of Autism and the needs of Autistic individuals. It can be useful to identify your areas of concern before choosing an Occupational Therapist and trying to make your choice based on a therapists experience in these areas. Occupational Therapists may have undergone additional training in sensory processing or restricted eating for example."
Why might an Autistic individual require Occupational Therapy?,"Occupational Therapists work with Autistic people in a number of areas. However, one of the most common reasons an Autistic individual may require the support of an Occupational Therapist would be when sensory processing difficulties are impacting their participation in everyday activities. Occupational therapists can support with a number of other experiences of daily living (e.g., sleep, sexuality, puberty, play, handwriting, friendship, money management, advocacy)."
What role does an Occupational Therapist play in an Autism assessment?,"For children, the Autism assessment is typically multi-disciplinary in its approach. Members of a multi-disciplinary team may include an Occupational Therapist, Speech and Language Therapist and a Psychologist who each assess the child and collaborate to examine needs and ultimately come to a conclusion of the childs diagnosis. The role of an Occupational Therapist in the assessment of need is to focus on function (participation in everyday activities). For young children who may be pre-verbal, the assessment will be an observational assessment in which an Occupational Therapist may observe motor skills, play and sensory processing. They also may interview parents based on how their child manages everyday activities based on their age and typical development such as brushing teeth, toilet training and getting dressed for example. For older children or teenagers or even adults, the Occupational Therapist may speak directly with the individual being assessed about their everyday occupations, sensory challenges and general functioning."
How can I set up my home to be more accommodating for Autistic individuals?,"There are a number of changes you can make to provide an Autism-friendly environment where it is easy to regulate. Choose calming colours throughout the home such as muted greens, blues, pinks, soft oranges and neutrals and avoid over-use of patterns throughout the home. Choose matt paint rather than sheen as this tends to reflect the light more.  Ensure the house is as clutter-free as possible in order to keep a calm environment in the home.  If your Autistic child is sharing a bedroom with one of your children, try and separate off their space so that they feel like they have their own private calm space that they can retreat for self-regulation. Dream tents are great ways to do this in a smaller space.  Choose warm lighting rather than white or bright lights. Opt for using roller blinds rather than venetian wooden blinds which can reflect patterns of light through the house when the sun is shining.  Consider where rooms are in relation to the kitchen if the child is sensitive to food smells. For example, maybe your child could do their homework at a desk in their bedroom rather than at the kitchen table in order to help them focus on the task at hand and not be distracted by their sense of smell.  Some children may not like going into the bathroom to brush their teeth or use the toilet because of loud fans in the room. Can your child brush their teeth elsewhere or can the fan be replaced with a quieter alternative or is there another bathroom without a fan which they can use? Set up a sensory space in the home which your child can retreat to if they are feeling overwhelmed. Involve your child in setting up the sensory space in order to customise and tailor it to their needs. Allow them to choose sensory toys, fidgets or other equipment that might help them to feel relaxed and calm."
What challenges might an Autistic person face with self-care?,"Self-care involves many of the everyday tasks we perform to keep ourselves healthy, hygienic and safe. Examples of self-care include brushing our hair, teeth, washing, brushing hair, shaving and many more. Self-care can be challenging for Autistic individuals especially for those who may struggle with sensory difficulties. Some examples of sensory difficulties that an individual may encounter in relation to self-care include difficulties with the feeling of a toothbrush or the taste of toothpaste or struggles in relation to getting your hair touched, making hair washing and cutting difficult. Difficulties with textures of fabrics are also very common for example, seams, tags or harder materials like jeans etc., which could potentially pose problems with school uniforms or other dress codes.The goal of an occupational therapist is to assist the client to be as independent as possible in every day activities. Sometimes this may involve modifying the environment, the activities or learning a variety of sensory strategies. As discussed before, the variety within the Autism spectrum means that some Autistic people may require greater support in certain learning life skills than others."
Why do Autistic people sometimes struggle to organise themselves?,"Autism can mean a number of differences in how tasks are understood, processed and completed and may require support being organised. Occupational Therapists can help with many of these issues.Organisational skills involve being able to filter through all the information in our brain and to select the pieces of information that require our attention in order to prepare or complete a task. As a spectrum condition, Autism doesnt automatically mean poor attention or prevent someone being organised. In fact, lining up toys in ordered patterns is a common indicator for early years diagnosis. However, there are certain factors which can affect task management. As a result of commonly experienced sensory processing difficulties, Autistic people may not have the same ability to filter through the sensory input they are presented with as neurotypical people. Autistic people may not be able to filter beyond the sensory overload of noise, smells or feelings that they may be experiencing in order to pick out and process the important information coming into the brain. As the brain is so busy processing sensory information it can be very difficult to process and organize any other information. Some may compensate by developing their own organisational approach, but this may be hard to transfer."
How do I know what Autism language &communication sources I can trust online?,"These days we can easily access lots of valuable information and resources online. However, it is important that we identify key, reliable and trustworthy sources of information. There might be local support groups in your area or even online on social media sites such as Facebook. These can be useful places to go to for advice. Linking in with people who have been in a similar situation to you can be a great first step when looking for support. You can also look to trustworthy websites such as  HSE Irish Association of Speech and Language Therapists (IASLT) National Autistic Society (NAS) Middletown Centre for AutismWhen looking online, be careful that the information you are looking at is reliable. It is important that any interventions you find are evidence-based. Sometimes, if you feel like you are struggling to find something that works, you may feel like you are willing to try anything to help your child. It can be a good idea to go back to your trustworthy sources of information mentioned above and ask if anyone has any experience with that intervention or strategy etc. You should also check with your GP or Speech and Language Therapist if they are familiar with what you have come across online."
Why do some Autistic people struggle to understand non-literal language?,"Non-literal language is used in everyday communication. We use phrases like its raining cats and dogs or I have a frog in my throat, in our conversations. Autistic people can find this type of language confusing. One possible explanation for this may be that Autistic people are strong visual communicators. While we all engage areas of our visual processing systems while we communicate, Autistic people tend to access and use the visual systems in the brain in order to interpret all of the information that they hear. If you are using your visual system to picture these phrases or colloquialisms that come up in conversation it can become very confusing and difficult to get past this. For many Autistic people, they have to independently learn what people actually mean when they use these phrases and that can take quite a lot of time and effort. It can be useful to create visuals to explain what common phrases using non-literal language mean in order to help. You must be aware that if you are using non-literal language or even being sarcastic in your conversation with an Autistic person, it can be difficult for them to understand or pick up on."
What is ASD?,"Autism Spectrum Disorder is a grouping of neurological disorders that results from abnormal development that causes problems with social interaction, communication, and limited or repetitive behaviors."
What is meant by the term “spectrum” in Autism Spectrum Disorder?,"Each child diagnosed with ASD is as unique as their symptoms. There is a popular phrase in the Autism community —  “if you’ve seen one child with Autism, you’ve seen ONE child with Autism.” This is meant to reiterate the fact that no two autistic persons will look, behave, or react the same way to the disorder. Rather than a checklist of signs and symptoms like diseases, Autism is a neurological disorder that manifests with differing symptoms and severity in each patient."
I suspect my child may have autism. What does this look like and what should I do to find out?,"Autism, or autism spectrum disorder (ASD), is a condition that results in challenges with communicating verbally and non verbally, relating to others and the world around them, and thinking and behaving flexibly.Early signs for a baby or toddler may include difficulty in the following areas:Making eye contact, such as looking at you when being fed or smiling whenbeing smiled atResponding to his or her name, or to the sound of a familiar voiceFollowing objects visually or follow your gesture when you point things outPointing or waving goodbye, or use other gestures to communicateMaking noises to get your attentionInitiating or responding to cuddling or reaching out to be picked upImitating your movements and facial expressionsPlaying with other people or sharing interest and enjoymentNoticing or caring if you hurt yourself or are experiencing discomfortThe range of challenges varies greatly from person to person which is why it is called a spectrum disorder. If you have concerns about your child’s development- don’t wait. Early intensive intervention is proven to improve outcomes significantly.Learning the signs, looking at your child’s developmental milestones, and getting an evaluation to start treatment can make a tremendous difference. It is important to note that not all concerns result in an autism diagnosis but being proactive is crucial. Bottom line is – you know your child best. If you are concerned SPEAK UP. Talk to your doctor and professionals in child development. Prepare for this conversation with specific concerns and examples. Note your child’s peers and what they are up to."
How common is autism and what causes it?,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates autism’s prevalence as 1 in 59 children in the United States. This includes 1 in 37 boys and 1 in 151 girls. Autism appears to have its roots in very early brain development, and the reasons why some children have autism and others do not are not well understood. We do know that there is no one single cause for autism. Research suggests that it can be a combination of genetic, nongenetic, or environmental influences. Research continues to be ongoing."
How is Autism diagnosed?,"A diagnosis for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) can be made based on developmental milestones and behaviors. Unlike other disorders, there is no conclusive test, and diagnosis is based purely on observation. To be diagnosed with ASD, a child must meet criteria that include deficits in social communication, interpersonal interactions, and restrictive or repetitive behaviors."
What do I do if I suspect Autism in my child?,"Share your concerns with your pediatrician right away. The sooner it is diagnosed and interventions are implemented, the better the outcome will be for your child."
Can Autism be cured?,"There is no known cure for ASD, but it is treatable with early intervention and therapies like Applied Behavior Analytics (ABA) therapy."
"If one of my children has Autism, will future children also have it?","While there is a complex genetic link to some forms of Autism, statistics report that only one in five younger siblings of a person with Autism will have/develop symptoms themselves."
How can you tell ASD from ADD/ADHD?,"Sometimes the disorders co-occur, so sometimes the answer to this question may not be as clear. While children with ADD/ADHD may find it difficult to focus and often fidget, they don’t typically have repetitive movements or difficulty with social interaction and communication the way children with ASD do. If your child exhibits symptoms of both disorders, they may be one of the 18% of children who manifest both."
What causes Autism Spectrum Disorder?,"Autism is caused by abnormal brain development, but there is no clear answer yet as to what causes abnormal development. There is some evidence that complex genetic factors may play a small role, but there is no known single cause of Autism."
Do vaccines cause Autism?,No. There is significant evidence proving that vaccines and their ingredients do not cause Autism. This common myth originated from false documentation as part of a fraudulent study published by a doctor who later lost his medical license when his claims were debunked.
Why do children with Autism have difficulty learning in a regular classroom setting?,"Social interactions aside, some symptoms associated with ASD include learning and intellectual disabilities, speech and communication delays, aggression or self-harm behaviors, unpredictability, and poor peer interaction skills that may limit their ability to fully participate in classroom activities or learn in a traditional setting."
What do I do after my child is diagnosed with Autism?,"The best thing to do is educate yourself about the disorder, your child’s specific symptoms, and find resources and treatments in your area. The sooner you begin interventions, the better the outcome will likely be. Parent support groups and local resources can be incredibly helpful. It is important not to blame yourself or your child and remember to take care of yourself and your other children as well."
"My child was developing normally and began regressing as a toddler, is this Autism?",It could be a form of late-onset Autism Disorder such as Rett’s Syndrome or Childhood Disintegrative Disorder (CDD). It is important to discuss your concerns with your pediatrician.
Is Autism contagious?,"No, Autism is not contagious."
What are Autism signs in adults?,"Autism is often thought of as a condition that only affects children, but it is important to recognize that autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a lifelong condition. In fact, many people with autism are not diagnosed until adulthood, as symptoms can be subtle and may be attributed to other conditions such as anxiety or depression. If left unrecognized and untreated, autism can impact a person’s social, emotional, and occupational functioning. That’s why it’s important to be aware of the signs and symptoms of autism in adults. In this blog, we will discuss some of the key indicators of autism in adults, as well as resources and support for those who may be affected by this condition.
Below are some of the signs that adults with Autism experience."
What are Autism signs in Anxiety and Sensory Overload?,"• You may have noticed that your loved one has difficulty tuning out background noise and feels anxious or stressed in these situations. This can be especially true if he or she is already feeling overwhelmed by the people around him or her.
• If you notice that your loved one becomes anxious when there are lots of people around him, try taking him somewhere quieter–like a park or library–to help him calm down before returning to the crowded place."
What are Autism signs in Understanding and Expressing Complex Emotions?,"• Difficulty processing and expressing emotions
• Inability to understand the emotions of others
• Appearing detached or unemotional in situations where most people would express strong emotions"
What are Autism signs in Difficulty with Transition?,"• When there is a change in routine, such as starting a new job or moving to a new house, adults with autism may struggle. They can become anxious or upset when the usual routine is disrupted."
What are Autism signs in Interacting with Others?,"• Difficulty interpreting nonverbal cues, such as facial expressions or body language. This can make social interactions challenging and may lead to the person feeling awkward in group settings.
• Struggling to initiate or maintain conversations and coming across as aloof or uninterested in others."
What are Autism signs in Difficulty with Abstract Concepts?,"• Abstract concepts are difficult for many people with autism, but they can be especially challenging for adults. This can lead to problems with figurative language and metaphors. For example, if someone says “The elephant in the room,” an autistic person may not understand that this means there is a problem that needs to be addressed or talked about openly.
• Similarly, jokes or sarcasm might not make sense because they rely on abstract concepts like irony and humour–things that are hard for those with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) to grasp."
What are Autism signs in Repetitive Behaviors?,"• Engaging in repetitive behaviours, such as rocking back and forth or flicking fingers
• Self-soothing by engaging in these behaviours to calm down or regulate their emotions (e.g., when they are upset). This may be a sign that they have sensory processing issues that need to be addressed through occupational therapy.
• Becoming fixated on certain objects or topics and having difficulty shifting attention to other things is another sign of autism in adults."
What are Autism signs in Nonverbal Communication?,"• Difficulty understanding nonverbal cues, such as facial expressions or tone of voice.
• Struggling to use nonverbal cues effectively when communicating with others.
• Someone with ASD might not use eye contact when speaking with you because they don’t realize that this is an important part of the conversation.
• A person with ASD may not understand that certain facial expressions mean something different than what they mean for most people; so when someone smiles at them in greeting or surprise–or frowns angrily–it doesn’t register as such for them until later on when they’ve had time to process what happened during an interaction between two individuals who were present at once but weren’t communicating verbally either directly through speech or indirectly through body language signals like hand gestures or facial expressions"
What are Autism signs in Communication?,"• Difficulty initiating or maintaining conversations
• Difficulty expressing thoughts and feelings in a clear way
• Appearing to be uninterested in the conversations of others"
What are Autism signs in Understanding the Perspective of Others?,"• The ability to understand the perspectives of others and to see things from their point of view is called “theory of mind.” In adults with autism, this skill may be underdeveloped.
• For example, it can be challenging for them to empathize with others or understand the impact of their actions on others.
• This difficulty in understanding other people’s thoughts and feelings can make social interactions difficult. It can also lead an adult with autism to misinterpret other people’s intentions or motivations (for example: thinking someone is laughing at him when they’re not)."
What are Autism signs in Executive Functioning Skills?,"The executive functioning skills of an adult with autism may be significantly impaired. These include:
• Difficulty with planning or organization, such as prioritizing tasks and breaking down larger tasks into smaller manageable steps.
• Having trouble with abstract thinking, such as being unable to see the big picture or understand how certain actions will affect others in the future (e.g., “If I do this today, what will happen later?”).
• Problems with self-monitoring (e.g., not noticing when you are feeling angry or upset)."
What are Autism signs in Sensory Processing?,"• Sensory processing is the way that your brain interprets information from the five senses. It’s how you make sense of what you see, hear, feel and taste.
• It can be difficult to understand why someone with autism would have difficulty with sensory processing if you don’t have it yourself. But imagine going through life with everything feeling like it’s on high volume or too bright–and then add in having an overload of information coming in at once that makes it hard to focus on anything specific.
• When someone has sensory processing issues related to autism:
• They may become overwhelmed by certain stimuli such as loud noises or bright lights; they may need time alone after being exposed to these things so they can calm down before returning to society again (similarly to how we might need time alone after going out for dinner).
• Some people may find themselves avoiding certain foods because they are too crunchy/salty/spicy/etc."
What are Autism signs in adults?,"Here is a summary of 15 Autism signs in adults
• Anxiety and Sensory Overload: Feeling overwhelmed in a crowded or noisy place, such as a shopping mall or a busy restaurant. Difficulty tuning out background noise and feeling anxious or stressed in these situations.
• Understanding and Expressing Complex Emotions: Struggling with processing and expressing emotions, such as grief or love. Difficulty understanding the emotions of others and appearing detached or unemotional in situations where most people would express strong emotions.
• Difficulty with Transitions: Struggling when there is a change in routine, such as starting a new job or moving to a new house. Becoming anxious or upset when the usual routine is disrupted.
• Interacting with Others: Difficulty interpreting nonverbal cues, such as facial expressions or body language, which can make social interactions challenging. Struggling to initiate or maintain conversations and coming across as aloof or uninterested in others.

"What are Autism signs in Autism in Adults: Diagnosis, Treatment, and Resources?","Diagnosing autism in adults can be challenging, as symptoms can vary widely and may be masked by other conditions such as anxiety or depression. It’s important to consult a general physician or a specialist to finalize a diagnosis. Early diagnosis is crucial for effective intervention and treatment, even if you have transitioned into adulthood without having a formal diagnosis. A comprehensive evaluation by a qualified healthcare professional is necessary to determine whether someone has autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This may include a physical exam, medical history, and psychological testing. The diagnostic process may also involve assessments of communication, social skills, and behaviour.
Once a diagnosis of ASD is confirmed, treatment options can be explored, which may include therapy, medication, and support services. Behavioural therapy, such as applied behaviour analysis (ABA), can help individuals with ASD learn new skills and behaviours, while medication may be used to manage symptoms such as anxiety or depression.

"
What is Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)?,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects brain development and influences how individuals perceive and interact with others. It can lead to challenges in communication and socialization, along with repetitive behaviors. The term ""spectrum"" highlights the variety of symptoms and their intensity."
What are the signs and symptoms of ASD related to social communication and interaction?,"Limited response: Your child may not respond when you call their name or may not seem to hear you at times.
Preference for solitude: They might resist being cuddled and prefer to play alone, withdrawing into their own space.
Eye contact issues: Poor eye contact and a lack of facial expressions are common.
Speech difficulties: Some children might not speak at all or show delays in speech development. In some cases, they may lose previously learned words or sentences.
Conversation challenges: They might struggle to start or maintain a conversation. When they do speak, it may only be for requests or to name objects.
Unique speech patterns: Their voice might sound unusual, such as using a singsong tone or robotic speech.
Echolalia: They may repeat words or phrases without understanding their meaning.
Understanding problems: Some may not grasp simple questions or directions.
Emotion expression: There may be a lack of expression regarding emotions or an unawareness of others’ feelings.
Sharing interests: Your child might not point to or bring objects to share with others.
Social interaction issues: They may approach social situations in inappropriate ways, such as being passive, aggressive, or disruptive.
Difficulty with nonverbal cues: Recognizing facial expressions, body language, or tone of voice can be a struggle."
What are the common patterns of behavior associated with ASD?,"Repetitive movements: Common actions include rocking, spinning, or flapping hands.
Self-harm activities: Some might engage in self-harm, like biting or banging their heads.
Ritualistic behavior: They often create routines and may become upset if there are small changes.
Coordination issues: This can involve clumsiness or odd movements, like walking on tiptoes or having stiff body language.
Fascination with details: Your child may focus intensely on small details of objects, such as the wheels on a toy, without understanding how these objects function."
When should you see a doctor if you suspect ASD?,"If you have concerns about your child’s development or suspect they may have ASD, it is important to consult with your physician. Symptoms of autism can share similarities with other developmental disorders, and early intervention is crucial."
What are some early signs of autism spectrum disorder in children?,"Response to emotions: Your child should respond with a smile or happy expression by 6 months.
Mimicking: By 9 months, they should mimic sounds or facial expressions.
Babbling: Cooing or babbling should be present by 12 months.
Gestures: Pointing or waving should occur by 14 months.
First words: Saying single words should happen by 16 months.
Pretend play: By 18 months, your child should engage in make-believe play.
Two-word phrases: Speaking in two-word phrases should start by 24 months.
Loss of skills: Losing language or social skills at any age should prompt a consultation."
Toys for children with autism?,"Children with autism often benefit from toys that stimulate the senses and promote motor skills development. Toys such as puzzles help develop problem-solving abilities, while building blocks and construction toys enhance hand-eye coordination. Soft toys or sensory-friendly materials offer tactile stimulation and comfort. Interactive toys (like fidget spinners or squishy toys) can help children with autism regulate their sensory input and focus."
Activities for child with autism?,"Activities for children with autism are best when they match the child’s interests and developmental needs. Structured and predictable activities help children feel secure. Arts and crafts foster creativity, and building activities like Legos can help improve fine motor skills. Sensory play (e.g., water or sand play) provides a calming experience and promotes sensory integration. Exercise activities like jumping or dancing help release excess energy and regulate emotions. Music therapy is particularly effective for encouraging social interaction and communication."
Sensory toys for child with autism?,"Sensory toys are designed to stimulate one or more of the five senses (touch, sight, hearing, smell, and taste). Weighted blankets or vests provide deep pressure input that has a calming effect. Fidget toys (e.g., spinners, cubes, and squeezable toys) are helpful for children who need to focus or manage anxiety. Vibrating toys can provide sensory feedback, while tactile toys (like textured balls or fabrics) are great for children with tactile sensitivities."
Sensory activities for children with autism?,"Sensory activities are crucial for children with autism because they help them process sensory input and regulate emotions. Activities such as playing in a sensory bin filled with rice, beans, or sand can engage the sense of touch. Water play (splashing or pouring) can be soothing, while swinging or jumping on a trampoline provides proprioceptive input that helps with body awareness. Playdough, finger painting, or using textured items help with fine motor skills while also offering tactile stimulation."
Sensory diet for children with autism?,"A sensory diet refers to a structured plan that includes various sensory activities to help a child stay regulated. The goal is to prevent sensory overload or under-stimulation by balancing sensory inputs. The sensory diet may include activities like deep pressure (e.g., squeezing or hugging), swinging, jumping on trampolines, or listening to calming music. These activities can help manage sensory sensitivities, regulate attention, and improve focus."
Chewable toys for children with autism?,"Many children with autism may have a need for oral stimulation, which can help them focus or calm down. Chewable toys, often made of non-toxic materials like silicone, allow children to satisfy this need safely. These toys are available in various shapes, such as chewable necklaces, tubes, or pencil toppers. They can be used to reduce anxiety, prevent chewing on inappropriate objects, or simply to help children regulate sensory input."
Autism sleep problems?,"Children with autism commonly experience sleep disturbances, including difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up frequently during the night. Sleep problems may stem from sensory sensitivities (e.g., difficulty with light, sound, or temperature), anxiety, or other co-occurring conditions such as ADHD. A bedtime routine and environmental adjustments (e.g., calming lights, weighted blankets, or noise-reducing headphones) can help children with autism sleep better."
Is autism genetic?,"There is strong evidence to suggest that autism has a genetic component. Research indicates that autism tends to run in families, and certain genetic conditions (e.g., fragile X syndrome or Rett syndrome) are associated with a higher risk of autism. However, autism is not caused by a single gene; rather, multiple genes likely contribute to its development. Environmental factors, such as prenatal exposure to toxins or infections, can also increase the risk, though they do not directly cause autism."
Autism risk factors?,"Several risk factors can increase the likelihood of a child being diagnosed with autism. These include having a sibling with autism, being born to older parents, and exposure to environmental toxins during pregnancy (e.g., lead, pesticides, or certain medications). Genetic factors, such as a family history of developmental disorders, can also contribute. Research into environmental and genetic interactions continues to evolve, as both genetic and non-genetic factors may play a role."
Autism Treatments?,"There is no cure for autism, but various treatments can help children manage symptoms and develop skills. Behavioral therapies, such as Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA), teach children new behaviors and social skills. Speech therapy helps children improve communication skills, while occupational therapy focuses on enhancing daily living skills. Social skills training helps children navigate interactions with peers. Sensory integration therapy addresses sensory processing issues, and medications may be prescribed to manage related conditions like anxiety or hyperactivity."
Autism Impacts?,"Autism can impact various aspects of a child’s life, including social communication, behavior, and sensory processing. Social challenges may include difficulty understanding non-verbal cues, making friends, or engaging in reciprocal conversation. Behavioral issues might include repetitive behaviors (e.g., hand-flapping) or difficulty with transitions. Sensory processing difficulties can cause children to be overly sensitive or under-sensitive to sensory input (e.g., loud sounds, bright lights). Autism impacts can vary greatly depending on the severity and individual characteristics of the child."
Autism signs in girls and women?,"Autism presents differently in girls and women compared to boys. Girls often have better-developed verbal skills and are more likely to mimic social behaviors, which can mask the signs of autism. They may also be more likely to develop interests or hobbies that align with social expectations, such as caring for dolls or engaging in social play. As a result, autism is often underdiagnosed in females, and they may struggle with social anxiety, depression, or low self-esteem due to the difficulties they face in social situations."
Autism Severity Levels?,"Autism is categorized into three severity levels based on the level of support required:    Level 1: Individuals with Level 1 autism have mild symptoms and may only need minimal support in social situations or with behaviors. They can communicate and function independently but might struggle in unfamiliar or highly social settings.    Level 2: Those with Level 2 autism need substantial support. They may have more noticeable difficulties with communication and social interaction and exhibit repetitive behaviors.    Level 3: This is the most severe level, where individuals require very substantial support. They may have significant impairments in communication, social interaction, and adaptive behavior."
Autism Diagnosis for children?,"The diagnosis of autism in children is typically made by a developmental pediatrician, psychologist, or other specialists. It involves a comprehensive evaluation, including a developmental history, observation, and standardized diagnostic tools such as the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS). Early diagnosis (usually around age 2) is beneficial for creating effective intervention plans."
Autism Diagnosis as an adult?,"Autism may also be diagnosed in adulthood, especially in individuals who were not diagnosed as children. The process involves a thorough evaluation of developmental history, self-reported symptoms, and interviews with people familiar with the individual’s behavior over time. Many adults with autism have learned to cope with their symptoms, which can make diagnosis more challenging, but it can provide clarity and access to services and support."
What are Autism Spectrum Disorders?,"Autism spectrum disorders(ASDs) represent a range of brain disorders that are characterized by restricted patterns of behavior and impairments in social communication and interactions. These disorders share common origins and features, but are classified as spectrum disorders because symptoms and severity vary among individuals."
What are the symptoms of Autism Spectrum Disorders?,"Symptoms/behaviors of ASDs can range from mild to severe, and may seem to appear gradually or suddenly. Atypical development may be observed from birth, or more commonly, become noticeable during the 12- to 36-month period. Symptoms include:

- Social Deficits- Children with autism have difficulty in social interactions. They may avoid eye contact and interactions with people and resist or passively accept attention. They are often unable to read social cues or exhibit emotional reciprocity. Thus, they are unable to predict or understand other peoples’ behavior. They may also have difficulty controlling emotion, may be disruptive or aggressive at times, or may lose control, especially when frustrated or presented with a new situation or environment. Head-banging, hair-pulling and arm-biting may occur.

- Communication Difficulties- Communication skills are affected in children with autism, but difficulties vary. Some children may have good basic language skills, but exhibit difficulty initiating or sustaining conversations, such as not giving others the opportunity to respond. Others may experience delays or regression in language development; still others remain mute or may use language in unusual ways, such as repeating a phrase, or parroting what they hear (echolalia). Body language is also often hard to read in children with autism. Facial expressions, tone of voice and gestures often do not match verbal content and emotions. They have difficulty expressing what they want or need. They may also appear deaf, not responding to their names or attempts at conversation.

- Repetitive Behaviors- Patterns of behavior, interests and activities may be restricted, repetitive or stereotyped. For example, a child may spend long periods of time arranging specific toys in a particular manner, rather than playing with the toys. Intense preoccupation with certain topics, such as obsessively studying maps, may also be seen. Odd repetitive motions, either extreme or subtle, such as arm-flapping, freezing, rocking back and forth or walking on their toes may also occur. Often, people with autism demand consistency in their environment. A minor change in routine may be tremendously upsetting.

- Sensory Difficulties- In children with autism, the brain seems unable to balance the senses appropriately. Many autistic children are highly attuned or even painfully sensitive to certain sounds, textures, tastes or smells. Some seem oblivious to cold or pain, but react hysterically to things that wouldn't bother other children. In some people, the senses are even scrambled. For example, touching a certain texture may induce a gagging response.

- Unusual Abilities- In rare cases, some children with ASDs display remarkable abilities, such as drawing detailed, realistic pictures at a young age or playing an instrument without training. Some can memorize difficult lists of items, such as statistics or names (this is called islets of intelligence or savant skills)."
What is Autistic Disorder?,"Autistic disorder, commonly referred to as autism, is the most prevalent ASD and severely impairs a child’s social interaction and communication abilities."
What is Asperger's Syndrome?,"Asperger's Syndrome is the second most common ASD and is a milder form of autism. Children with Asperger’s Syndrome exhibit higher language development than children with autism and often have normal intellectual ability combined with a disinterest in social communication. Children with Asperger’s may not initiate or sustain a conversation and do not compensate for their limited language by using nonverbal means of communication, thus limiting their peer relationships. Similar to autism, children with Asperger’s do not share enjoyment or interests with others."
What are the other ASDs (besides Autism and Asperger's Syndrome)?,"Other disorders in the spectrum include pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDDNOS) and two rarer disorders—childhood disintegrative disorder (CDD) and Rett’s syndrome. Children with PDDNOS demonstrate symptoms similar to autistic disorder, but do not meet all criteria for the disorder. Children with CDD, which affects more boys than girls, develop normally until approximately the first two years of life (average onset of symptoms is between 3 and 4 years) but they then regress in most areas and continue worsening. Specifically, they experience a pronounced loss in motor, language, social and intellectual skills. They also lose bowel and bladder control. Seizures may even occur."
What is Rett Syndrome?,"Rett syndrome is a genetic disorder almost exclusively found in females. After early normal development, autistic symptoms begin to develop between 6 and 18 months, which typically include shunning social contact, talking cessation, unique motor behaviors, and a regression in skills. A single gene mutation has been identified as a cause of Rett syndrome, a finding that may enable researchers to develop improved diagnostics, earlier interventions and better treatments for the condition."
Who Develops Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs)?,"ASDs are usually evident by the age of 3, though diagnosis may be made as early as 12 to 18 months, and as late as 4 to 6 years (or later). According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), about1 in 59 children have an autism spectrum disorder. ASDs are three to four times more common in boys than in girls. However, girls with these disorders tend to have more severe symptoms and lower intelligence. Some children will need ongoing supervision, while others, with the right support, may pursue higher education and fulfilling jobs. These disorders affect people of all racial, ethnic and socioeconomic groups."
How Are ASDs Diagnosed?,"To date, no biological diagnostic tests exist that detect autism. But scientists are hopeful that advanced imaging techniques and differences in blood levels of proteins in autistic versus normal children may have implications for diagnosis. Already, improved diagnostic procedures have allowed clinicians to diagnose children at a younger age.

Formal diagnosis involves parental input and structured and systematic screening instruments, such as the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT) and the Autism Behavioral Checklist (ABC) for older children. The Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) and the Autism Diagnostic Inventory-Revised (ADI-R) are used, as well. These tools measure the prevalence of symptoms. Symptoms may be present from birth, or may occur after months of normal development. However, no two children with these disorders behave the same way. Children as young as 18 months may be diagnosed, but have different clinical features than an older child with autism.

Between 18 months and 36 months, symptoms may include:

- Limited pretend play

- Lack of pointing to demonstrate interest

- Reduced gaze following

- Less frequent demonstration of repetitive, stereotypic behaviors

- In children with autism between 2 years and 3 years of age, the following features may be observed:

- Communication difficulties

- Socialization deficits with caregivers

- Perceptual sensitivity

- Other difficult behaviors"
What Are the Causes of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs)?,"Some combination of genetic, biological and environmental factors is believed to cause ASDs. Researchers are exploring several genes which are believed to contribute to the development of these disorders as well as several brain regions that have been linked to the disorders. Abnormal brain development during the first months of life is being studied to determine if structural abnormalities, such as in the mirror neuron systems, may be caused by genetic and/or environmental factors. Researchers are also exploring the effects of genetic imprinting in which a gene’s expression is determined by which parent donates the gene copy. Certain neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, dopamine, and epinephrine, may also function abnormally. In some cases, scientists are exploring the possibility that a faulty immune response to a virus, elevated concentrations of proteins in the blood at birth, dysregulation of specific neuropeptides or a major stress during pregnancy may lead to the disorder."
How are ASDs treated?,"There is no one treatment for ASDs; however, it is widely accepted that the earliest interventions allow the best outcomes.  Treatments generally address both cognitive and behavioral functioning. They may include a combination of medications (for challenging behaviors), behavioral therapy, psycho-education, family support groups, educational interventions, speech and language therapy, occupational therapy and specialized training to develop and improve acquisition of necessary skills.

Research has found that a newer class of atypical antipsychotic medications may better treat the serious behavioral disturbances in children with autism who are between 5 and 17 years old. Applied behavioral analysis may be an effective adjunctive treatment in reinforcing desirable and reducing undesirable behaviors. Other work focuses on improving social communication in children with autism. Some have found that structured multidisciplinary behavioral programs are more successful. Parental involvement, a predictable schedule, regular behavior reinforcement and active engagement of attention in highly structured activities to enhance a strength or ability may all contribute to creating an effective treatment program."
What is autism?,"Autism usually appears in the early years of a child’s life. It can affect a person’s communication, relationships, social skills, and self-regulation. It is known and often referred to as a spectrum because each person’s experience will vary a lot. Early intervention, therapies and education will help that person lead a life of choice and opportunity."
What causes autism?,"There is not one known cause for autism. It is something you are born with rather than something you catch or develop over time. It has been proven by researchers from Statens Serum Institut and the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, and Stanford University School of Medicine in the US, that vaccines and certain types of foods do not cause autism. Vaccinating your child is important to protect them from other illnesses."
Can autism be cured and can autism go away?,"Autism is a lifelong condition; it is something you are born with and is usually identified in early childhood. It cannot be ‘cured’; if diagnosed early, education and where appropriate, therapy can help with the child’s development and communication, so they can live a life full of freedom and opportunity."
Does autism run in families?,"Autism can sometimes affect people in the same family. The direct impact of genetics on autism is unknown however, so we don’t know if autism can be inherited."
What are main characteristics of autism?,"There are many different signs and indicators of autism in adults and children, which can often be mistaken for other conditions. It’s important that if you suspect you, or someone you love has autism, then seeking a diagnosis could help with getting the support that is available."
Some of the common signs of autism in young children:,"

1. Not responding to their name
2. Avoiding eye contact
3. Not smile when you smile at them
4. Becoming very upset if they do not like a certain taste, smell, or sound (sensory overload)
5. Engaging in repetitive movements, such as rocking back and forth or tapping surfaces
6. Not talking as much as their peers
7. Repeating the same phrases
"
Some of the common signs of autism in older children and adults:,"

1. Not seeming to understand what others are thinking or feeling, or being able to empathise with that person
2. Finding it difficult to talk about their feelings
3. Like having a strict daily routine and may become very upset if it changes
4. Having a very keen interest in very specific subjects or activities which some may consider obsessive
5. Finding socialising and making friends difficult or preferring to be on their own
6. Taking things very literally – for example, not understanding phrases like “break a leg”

How do I find out if I’m autistic?,"If you identify with any of the common signs of autism; difficulty in understanding what others are feeling, anxiety in social situations, difficulty with changes in routine or any of the others listed above, there are steps you can take. Try speaking with your GP or a psychologist about getting a referral. Or there may be an autism centre in your local area that you could speak to.Find out more about diagnosis."
Do boys and girls have autism?,"Yes, both boys and girls can have autism. It is quite common that the signs of autism often manifest differently, are missed or diagnosed as another condition within girls. Autism in boys is more frequently recognised than autism in girls. This has led to the wide held belief that only boys have autism and not girls, which is in fact not true, and because of this, can sometimes make it harder for girls to receive the help and support they need. Read our blog post formore information on autism and women."
Can you develop autism as an adult?,"Autism can only be diagnosed when the signs have been present from early childhood (i.e. before 3). It is possible to receive a late diagnosis if the signs have always been present. If you or someone you know has suddenly developed behavioural or communication issues which were not present before, then this is likely down to another condition. You cannot develop autism in adulthood. If autism is suspected or even another condition, then this should be investigated."
Is there anything I can do to prevent my child from having autism?,"You cannot do anything specific to prevent your child having autism; however, your child will grow and develop with the right education, support, and therapies."
Why are sensory activities important for autistic people?,"Sensory activities help stimulate the brain and cognitive skills, develop social skills, and improve coordination and physical development. Some people are sensory seekers and others will avoid situations.  Everyone’s sensory needs are different. Some sensory activity is also used for relaxation and comfort."
What is masking?,"Masking is a very common trait in autistic people, especially girls. Masking is where an autistic person will consciously or unconsciously try to hide certain behaviours. They may stop themselves flapping their hands or making a noise to fit in with societal norms. This can lead to people not getting the support they need. As a society we need to be more inclusive so that people can feel comfortable being themselves."
Why are autistic children considered naughty?,"Some people believe that autistic children are naughty or poorly behaved. This belief, especially if shared with the child, can be incredibly damaging to the child’s metal wellbeing, as well as spreading misconceptions. Behaviour serves a function and should be viewed as a form of communication. Some autistic people communicate differently because their understanding of communication is different. We prefer to call some of these types of behaviour ‘behaviours that challenge’ as it is much more respectful to that child and their family. Behaviours that challenge can stem from feelings of frustration or being in an overstimulating environment. Consideration should be made about what the triggers are for that behaviour so they can be resolved, rather than just punishing the child. This approach is true for all children not just those who have autism."
What’s it like having autism?,Everyone feels differently about their autism. Some people may be uncomfortable discussing it and other people view it as an important part of their identity. It’s always worth checking how that person feels and what their preferences are before discussing with them.
Can you have autism and be social?,"Autism is different for everyone. Some autistic people find reading body language or understanding peoples’ emotions difficult and therefore find making friends tricky. They may also feel anxious in certain social situations. However, that doesn’t mean this is the case for everyone."
Is OCD a form of autism?,"There are similarities between the two, but OCD is not a form of autism. Fixations on routine and compulsive like repetitive behaviours can be found in both. For an autistic person these behaviours are often soothing or bring enjoyment, whereas with OCD the compulsions can be upsetting to the person."
Why is my autistic child having problems sleeping?,"It’s not uncommon for autistic children to have sleep issues. There are a range of factors that contribute to this including increased anxiety, additional sensory needs and diet. These, amongst other circumstances, can impact upon sleep, causing your child to have too little or too much sleep. There are lots of things that you can do to support your child with their sleep. Sleep support strategies like keeping a diary, having a regular bedtime routine with visual timetables and ensuring the bedtime environment is appropriate can all help. For more information,read our blog on autism and sleep, which covers the issues and support strategies in more detail."
What is Autism Speaks policy on person-first or identity-first language?,"Autism Speaks utilizes both identity-first language (autistic person) and person-first (person with autism). In 2019 we polled our community about their preference and heard that there’s no ""one-size-fits-all"" approach. For that reason, we always recommend respecting individual preferences and using the language that feels most comfortable to the person on the spectrum."
How does Autism Speaks help autistic people?,"Autism Speaks is dedicated to creating an inclusive world for all individuals with autism throughout their lifespan. We do this through advocacy, services, supports, research and innovation, and advances in care for autistic individuals and their families."
What does Autism Speaks fund?,"As a charitable organization, it is important that we are good stewards of our donor funding and support. We pride ourselves on the fact that ninety cents of every dollar donated to Autism Speaks goes directly to research, advocacy, programs and services."
What is Autism Speaks doing in local communities?,Autism Speaks supports individuals and families in communities throughout North America and the impact that we have at the community level is a core part of our mission.
How has Autism Speaks evolved over the years?,"We have evolved as an organization as we learned more about autism and the lived experiences of autistic people. When we were founded in 2005, less was known about autism and the way it impacts people. In fact, in 2005 the prevalence was 1 in 166 and today the prevalence is 1 in 36."
Why did Autism Speaks remove “cure” from its mission and research?,"Since our founding in 2005, we have evolved as an organization as we learned more about autism and the lived experiences of autistic people. It was the right decision to remove searching for a “cure” from our mission and instead focus on providing advocacy and support, increasing understanding and acceptance and advancing research for the autistic community."
Why we removed the “I am Autism” video from our channels,"The ""I Am Autism"" video was posted in 2009 and quickly redacted.This video has been a great regret in the history of our organization, and we deeply apologize to those who we offended with it."
What is the significance of the puzzle piece logo?,"The puzzle piece originated 1963 when it was developed to raise autism awareness. While it is something we still use today, we regularly seek feedback and input from those within the autistic community to make sure Autism Speaks is reflective of the widest range of autistic individuals and their families and friends as possible."
What is the goal of Autism Speaks funded genetic research?,"Our work in genetics exists to help more autistic people access personalized, precision care that will empower them to lead their best lives."
What is Autism Speaks position on eugenics?,Autism Speaks does not support eugenics.
How does Autism Speaks represent the autism community within board and staff?,"We employ and engage autistic people, parents, and family members of people with autism as well as professionals and representatives who have experience and knowledge of autism. Some choose to disclose their autism while others do not. Their voices are represented across all staff and volunteer levels within Autism Speaks, including our board."
What is Autism Speaks stance on awareness and acceptance?,"At Autism Speaks, we are working towards a world where total acceptance of autistic people – beyond simple awareness - is the societal standard. We believe that awareness and acceptance are both crucial to building a better world for people on the spectrum, no matter their age, level of need or unique identity, as well as to fostering inclusion."
What is Autism Speaks stance on ABA (applied behavior analysis)?,"Applied behavior analysis (ABA) and therapies based on it, are evidence based and the most common behavioral interventions for autism."
What is Autism Speaks position on vaccines?,Scientists have conducted extensive research over the last two decades to determine there is no link between childhood vaccinations and autism. The result of this research is clear:Vaccines do not cause autism.
What is Autism Speaks position on autism interventions?,Autism Speaks supports the use of evidence-based interventions or treatments that have been carefully researched and show consistent expected outcomes based on empirical data. Evidence-based interventions for autism provide the best opportunity for positive outcomes.
What is Autism Speaks position on non-evidence-based practices or interventions?,"Autism Speaks does not support non-evidence-based practices or interventions. They could be potentially harmful or exploitative of resources. Unfortunately, these “treatments” are easy to find on the internet and sometimes specifically target newly diagnosed families."
Do vaccines cause autism spectrum disorder (ASD)?,"Many studies have looked at whether there is a relationship between vaccines and ASD. To date, the studies continue to show that vaccines arenotassociated with ASD.

For more information about vaccines and ASD, see the following sites:

• Thimerosal and Vaccines

• Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR) Vaccine

• Thimerosal in Flu Vaccine

• Timeline: Thimerosal in Vaccines (1999–2010)

• Autism and Vaccines"
Are more children being diagnosed with ASD?,"CDC is working with partners to study the prevalence of ASD over time so we can find out if the number of children with ASD is rising, dropping, or staying the same."
Can adults be diagnosed with ASD?,"Yes, adults can be diagnosed with ASD. Diagnosis includes looking at the person's medical history, watching the person's behavior, and giving the person some psychological tests. But it can be more challenging to diagnose an adult because it is not always possible to know about the person's development during the first few years of life, and a long history of other diagnoses may complicate an ASD diagnosis.

Because the focus of ASD research has been on children, we still have much to learn about the prevalence and causes of ASD across the lifespan. Behavioral interventions can be effective for adults coping with a new diagnosis of autism."
What are mitochondrial diseases or disorders?,"Mitochondria are tiny parts of almost every cell in your body. Mitochondria are like the power house of the cells. They turn sugar and oxygen into energy that the cells need to work.

In mitochondrial diseases, the mitochondria cannot efficiently turn sugar and oxygen into energy, so the cells do not work correctly.

There are many types of mitochondrial disease, and they can affect different parts of the body: the brain, kidneys, muscles, heart, eyes, ears, and others. Mitochondrial diseases can affect one part of the body or can affect many parts. They can affect those parts mildly or very seriously.

Not everyone with a mitochondrial disease will show symptoms. However, when discussing the group of mitochondrial diseases that tend to affect children, symptoms usually appear in the toddler and preschool years.

Mitochondrial diseases and disorders are the same thing."
Is there a relationship between mitochondrial disease and autism?,"A child with a mitochondrial disease

• May also have an autism spectrum disorder,

• May have some of the symptoms or signs of autism, or

• May not have any signs or symptoms related to autism.

A child with autism may or may not have a mitochondrial disease. When a child has both autism and a mitochondrial disease, they sometimes have other problems as well, including epilepsy, problems with muscle tone, and/or movement disorders.

More research is needed to find out how common it is for people to have autism and a mitochondrial disorder. Right now, it seems rare. In general, more research about mitochondrial disease and autism is needed."
What is regressive encephalopathy?,"Encephalopathy is a medical term for a disease or disorder of the brain. It usually means a slowing down of brain function. Regression happens when a person loses skills that they used to have, such as walking or talking or even being social.

Regressive encephalopathy means there is a disease or disorder in the brain that makes a person lose skills they once had.

We know that sometimes children with mitochondrial diseases seem to be developing as they should, but around toddler or preschool age, they regress. The disease was there all the time, but something happens that ""sets it off."" This could be something like malnutrition, an illness such as flu, a high fever, or dehydration, or it could be something else."
Is there a relationship between autism and encephalopathy?,Most children with an autism spectrum disorder do not have and have not had an encephalopathy. Some children with an autism spectrum disorder have had regression and some have had a regressive encephalopathy.
What do we know about the relationship between mitochondrial disease and other disorders related to the brain?,"Different parts of the brain have different functions. The area of the brain that is damaged by a mitochondrial disease determines how the person is impacted. This means that a person could have seizures, trouble talking or interacting with people, difficulty eating, muscle weakness, or other problems. They could have one issue or several."
Do vaccines cause or worsen mitochondrial diseases?,"As of now, there are no scientific studies that say vaccines cause or worsen mitochondrial diseases. We do know certain illnesses that can be prevented by vaccines, such as the flu, can trigger the regression that is related to a mitochondrial disease. More research is needed to determine if there are rare cases where underlying mitochondrial disorders are triggered by anything related to vaccines. However, we know that for most children, vaccines are a safe and important way to prevent life-threatening diseases."
Are all children routinely tested for mitochondrial diseases? What about children with autism?,"Children are not routinely tested for mitochondrial diseases. This includes children with autism and other developmental delays.

Testing is not easy and may involve taking multiple samples of blood, and often samples of muscle. Doctors decide whether testing for mitochondrial diseases should be done based on a child's signs and symptoms."
Should I have my child tested for a mitochondrial disease?,"If you are worried that your child might have a mitochondrial disease, talk to your child's doctor."
What is autism?,"Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social communication and interaction, and repetitive and stereotyped behaviors. Symptoms begin in early childhood, usually between the ages of 3 and 10, and develop gradually over time if left untreated."
Signs of autism in children?,"Children with signs of autism often have typical manifestations. Emotionally, when they were young, they did not know how to communicate with their parents, did not look directly into the eyes of the person opposite them, and had difficulty distinguishing between strangers and acquaintances. When going to school, children often withdraw into a corner, rarely communicating with anyone, including friends and teachers. Behaviorally, children have a habit of playing with a certain toy, enjoying the sounds they create themselves without caring about what their parents say. Some children even harm themselves by hitting their heads, scratching their bodies until they bleed. In terms of language, children show signs of slow speech, monotonous or meaningless sentences, sometimes they mumble to themselves with meaningless, unidentifiable words."
What are some ways to help autistic children integrate?,"Autistic children can live a normal life if abnormalities are detected early and timely intervention is provided. Do not hesitate to take your child to pediatric hospitals, autism care centers, specialized schools, autism schools to have more people/methods to help your child. Usually, children can be treated with combined methods such as drug therapy, behavioral therapy, etc. These methods aim to help children reduce inappropriate behaviors, encourage and teach children positive behaviors, help children gradually improve symptoms of autism and have a normal life like other children."
How to care for autistic children with their siblings?,"Take time to let the siblings of autistic children have a chance to feel the world of autistic children, let them quietly observe their struggling sibling, explain to them,... and ask for their support for their sick sibling. Don't scold them or speak too loudly, because those negative thoughts about autism are completely understandable - because they are young and do not have a complete understanding of autism. Instead, talk openly to know how they feel, and have a suitable explanation."
When should I take my child to see a doctor?,"Children should be seen by a doctor if they show the following signs: no smile or happy expression in response, no imitation of adult sounds or facial expressions, no gestures by 14 months, no words by 16 months, no two-word phrases by 24 months, and loss of language or social skills at any age. These signs may indicate that the child is at risk for autism and should be examined promptly for appropriate intervention."
Can autism be cured?,"To date, there is no way to completely cure autism spectrum disorder. However, in reality, early diagnosis, treatment and intervention can help improve and integrate children with autism better if they are properly cared for and attended to. People with autism have many behavioral disorders such as agitation, disruption, and instinctive release... and will be prescribed by doctors to reduce hyperactivity and help patients sleep better. In addition, these children need to learn language and build social skills. Depending on the severity of each patient, the doctor will examine and provide appropriate treatment."
Is autism in children dangerous?,"Yes. If a child has autism for a long time, he or she will be slow to speak, slow to develop, and tend to resolve conflicts with violence."
What is autism spectrum disorder?,"Autism spectrum disorder is a condition involving brain development that affects how a person perceives and interacts with others, and affects social interaction and communication. The disorder involves restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior. The term “spectrum” in autism spectrum disorder refers to the range of symptoms and severity of the disorder."
When does autism spectrum disorder typically begin in a child's life?,Autism spectrum disorders begin in early childhood. Children typically show symptoms of autism in their first year. A small number of children develop normally during this year. They then go through a period of regression between 18 and 24 months of age before symptoms of autism become apparent.
What are the symptoms of autism spectrum disorder?,"Some children show signs of autism spectrum disorder early in life, such as reduced eye contact, not responding to their name, or being indifferent to others. Other children may develop normally for the first few months or years of life but then suddenly become withdrawn and aggressive. Signs are usually seen by age 2. Children with autism spectrum disorder can have a unique pattern of behavior and severity, ranging from mild to severe. The severity of symptoms varies from child to child, so it can sometimes be difficult to determine. Diagnosis is usually based on the degree of impairment and the impact on functioning."
What causes autism spectrum disorder?,"The specific cause of autism spectrum disorder is not yet known. However, due to the complexity and severity of symptoms, the disease is likely due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors."
How do genetics influence autism spectrum disorder?,"For some children, autism spectrum disorder may be linked to a genetic disorder, such as Rett syndrome or Fragile X syndrome. In other cases, genetic mutations may increase the risk of autism spectrum disorder. Having a child with autism spectrum disorder increases the risk of other children having the disorder. Additionally, parents or other relatives of a child with autism spectrum disorder may have minor problems with communication skills or exhibit some of the symptoms of the disorder."
Are birth complications linked to autism spectrum disorder?,"Certain medications, such as valproic acid and thalidomide, when taken during pregnancy also put children at increased risk of autism."

What should parents do if their child has autism spectrum disorder?,"Parents of children with autism spectrum disorder should learn about the disorder and provide information about their child’s symptoms and habits to their doctor. They should connect with other parents of children with autism spectrum disorder to share their experiences and seek help from their doctor. In addition, spending time with your child is important to support their development and overcome the difficulties caused by autism spectrum disorder."

Treatment options include medication, behavioral interventions, psychological and educational interventions, and parent education."
What role do medications play in the treatment of autism spectrum disorders?,"Medications only help control the symptoms of autism spectrum disorder. For example, some medications are prescribed for hyperactivity, antipsychotics may be used to treat severe behavioral problems, and antidepressants may be prescribed to treat anxiety. It is important to consult your doctor before giving your child any medications or supplements."
"What role do behavioral, psychological, and educational interventions play in the treatment of autism spectrum disorders?","Many programs have been developed to address the social, language, and behavioral difficulties associated with autism spectrum disorder. Some programs focus on reducing unusual behaviors and teaching new skills, while others teach children how to act in social situations or communicate with others. Applied behavior analysis (ABA) can also help children learn new skills and generalize these skills across multiple situations."
What types of educational programs do children with autism spectrum disorder typically respond well to?,"Children with autism spectrum disorder often respond well to well-structured educational programs. Programs are organized by a team of professionals and include a variety of activities to improve social skills, communication, and behavior.

How many types of autism are there?,"Autism is divided into two types. The first is congenital autism: The form of autism develops from birth until the age of 3. The typical symptom is slow development. The second is atypical autism: The child still develops normally during the period from 12-30 months of age. After that, the child suddenly stops developing or loses all the abilities that the child has learned during the process of growing up."
What are repetitive behaviors and why do people with autism spectrum disorder often have them?,"Repetitive behaviors or interests may include actions such as rocking, spinning, hand flapping, biting, or head banging, discomfort with small changes, strange movement patterns, focusing on details of objects without understanding their purpose or function, unusual sensitivity to light or sound, but indifference to pain or temperature, failure to engage in imitative or pretend play, odd focus on a particular object or activity, and strange food preferences such as eating only certain foods."
How is autism divided based on intellectual ability and language development?,"Autism can be divided into four groups based on intellectual ability and language development. Children with autism who have high intelligence and normal communication skills are often placed in the first group. The second group is for children with autism who have high intelligence but have difficulty communicating. The third group includes children with autism who have low intelligence but still have communication skills. Finally, the fourth group is for children with autism who have low intelligence and have difficulty communicating. These groups help to differentiate and assess the appropriate support and care needs for each specific case."
How to care for and treat autistic children?,"Autism care and treatment requires close collaboration between parents, families, teachers, and the community. Treatment often includes special attention, psychological support, and other methods such as music, meditation, and yoga. Early intervention and consistent treatment can help improve a child's communication and social skills."
How do autistic children in Vietnam integrate into society today?,"Currently in Vietnam, there are some children with mild to moderate autism who have been able to integrate into mainstream schools after studying at centers.

• Difficulty changing routines
• Difficulty adapting to changes in the environment"
Causes of autism,"is not yet known, but scientists believe it is a combination of genetic and environmental factors.
The cause of autism:
is not yet known, but scientists believe it is a combination of genetic and environmental factors.
Genetic factors:
• Genetics plays the most important role in causing autism.
• If a parent or sibling has autism, the child is at higher risk of developing the disease.
• Scientists have identified a number of genes associated with autism, but these are only a small fraction of the genes that may contribute to the disease.
Environmental factors:
Some environmental factors may also increase a child's risk of autism, including:
• Infections during pregnancy or birth: Certain viruses and bacteria can affect the development of the fetal brain and increase the risk of autism.
• Exposure to toxic substances: Certain toxic substances, such as mercury and lead, can affect brain development and increase the risk of autism.

• Stress during pregnancy: Some studies suggest that stress during pregnancy may increase the risk of autism in children.

• Premature or low birth weight: Children born prematurely or with low birth weight are at higher risk of autism.
